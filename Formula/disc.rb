# Homebrew Formula for Disc
#
# Standard tap location after publication:
#   github.com/systemsoft/homebrew-disc/Formula/disc.rb
#
# Until the tap repo exists, this formula can be installed directly from the
# main repo for early adopters:
#   brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/systemsoft/disc/primary/homebrew/disc.rb
#
# Build path notes:
#   - Builds Disc from source via `deno compile` (no GitHub release artifacts
#     yet — bottle support waits on a published release pipeline).
#   - The brew-built binary does NOT bundle PostgreSQL: the build machine
#     has no `<DISC_HOME>/postgres/<version>/` cache, so the embedded-PG
#     manifest is empty and the runtime falls back to the network downloader
#     on first `disc init` / `disc serve`. This matches `DISC_BUILD_NO_BUNDLE_PG=1`
#     behavior and keeps the formula’s brew install footprint small.
#   - The UI IS bundled (the formula’s build steps run `bun run build` first
#     so `server/ui-assets.test.ts` and the runtime SPA path both work).
